# Personal-Digital-Portfolio

This project contains code for the website of a Personal Digital Portfolio implemented with Python using the Flask framework. This was implemented as part of my Cardiff Computing MSc course. 

This project scored distinction level marks, with the main critique being that the styling was functional, however a bit simplistic. 

If you wish to view the project without running it, there is a short video showcasing the main functionality of the site. 

Technologies used are Python, Flask, Jinja, Javascript, API call and response.
